# My Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio, showcasing my work and skills as a Full Stack Developer. The portfolio is built using Vite for faster development, styled with Tailwind CSS, and includes animations powered by Framer Motion. Additionally, I've integrated components from Accertinity UI, which I converted from TSX to JSX.

# Features
- Modern UI/UX: Designed with a sleek and responsive interface using Tailwind CSS.
- Smooth Animations: Interactive and visually appealing transitions with Framer Motion.
- Optimized Performance: Built with Vite for fast and efficient bundling.
- Accertinity UI Integration: Adapted UI components by converting them from TypeScript (TSX) to JavaScript (JSX) for better compatibility.
